# Urban Mobility Patterns Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains code and data for analyzing urban mobility patterns using synthetic datasets. Using data visualization and analysis we investigate factors such as transportation statistics, weather conditions, and special occurrences.

## Project Description
The project utilizes a <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/urban-mobility-dataset/data'>synthetic dataset from Kaggle</a> that includes various features such as:

- Pedestrian count: Number of pedestrians recorded per hour.
- Public transport usage: Number of users utilizing public transport per hour.
- Vehicle count: Number of vehicles passing a specific point per hour.
- Bike-sharing usage: Number of users utilizing bike-sharing services per hour.
- Weather conditions: Includes parameters such as temperature, humidity, and weather type (e.g., rain, snow).
- Events: Type of events occurring (e.g., concert, festival, sports).
- Holidays: Indicator of whether a day is a holiday.
- Road incidents: Number of road incidents reported per hour.
- Average delay in public transport: Delay times in minutes.
- Pedestrian incidents: Incidents involving pedestrians.
- Bike availability: Number of bikes available at bike-sharing stations.

The data spans from 2023 to 100 years in the future, covering daily and hourly measurements.
